      picture, stock, and the price of the product (product data can be hard coded in JSON format). 
    - POST API called using fetch or axios to save the invoice to database. 
    - Form cannot be submitted when at least one of the input boxes are empty. 
    - Show a warning message for invalid inputs (label or tooltip). 
    - Upon successful submission, proper notification pop-up should be shown. 

2. Section 2 - Invoice card
    - An invoice card with pagination to show invoices that have been published. 
    - The invoice cards should show summary of the invoice above such as customer name, salesperson name, total amount
      paid, and notes. 
    - The invoice data should be queried from backend using GET API using lazy loading method. 

3. Section 3 - Time-series graph
    - Show a graph to project revenue from invoices for daily, weekly, and monthly. 
    - It should enable user to pan and zoom to specific period. 
    - Auto scroll when new data is pushed.

## Installation Instruction

Open terminal and type this command

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Likssss/invoice-app-lix/
$ cd react-invoice-system
$ npm install
$ cd Frontend
$ npm install
$ cd ..
```

Change some database credential in folder `./backend/config/config.js`. You need to override the `data` variable using
your MySQL/MariaDB credential.

After database credential have been set, make sure you create database in your machine using `data.dbName` variable that
you have set before using this query.

```
CREATE DATABASE your-data.dbName;
```

After it successfully, then open di project directory again and open terminal, then make sure you're in the root of the
project directory, and run this command.

```
$ npm run serve
```

After server already running, open new tab terminal and type this command

```
$ cd frontend
$ npm run dev
```

And then open the local server on your browser to use the System.
